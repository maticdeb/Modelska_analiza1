Metropolis algorithm
Molecular catenoid: 17-segment chain-like molecule is fixed at both ends. Every segment
is at one of 19 equidistant height levels. Hamiltonian consists of gravitaional potential energy
and elastic energy, proportional to the square of height differences between neighbours. Find
an equillibrium state and equillibrium energy for different temperatures. For elementary step in
Metropolis algorithm, use a height change for one unit at a random segment.
