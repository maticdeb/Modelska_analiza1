Data Transfer  in a Network
The task involves scheduling data transfer in a network modeled as an N Ã— N square grid, where each edge has a randomly assigned maximum transmission speed between 0 and 1.
The nodes on the top row represent internet clients, and the nodes on the bottom row represent servers. The Kirchhoff's law is applicable to the internal nodes.
By using linear programming, determine the transmission speeds of servers and clients that maximize the overall data transfer rate.
Additionally, analyze the statistical distribution of relevant quantities due to the random nature of the network.
