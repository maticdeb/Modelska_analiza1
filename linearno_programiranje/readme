Linear programming
Designing diets for weight loss, healing or sport activities is a typical problem that can be solved by
linear programming. Given a set of foods, we can determine their optimal quantities while satisfing
certain limitations. We need to ensure proper daily amounts of minerals, vitamins and nutritients, as
well as limit the admittance of fat, carbohydrates and harmful materials, while still making sure the
energy value meets the personâ€™s demands
